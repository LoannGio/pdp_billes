# ball-flow simulator

## About the project

Authors : GIOVANNANGELI Loann, MAYOLINI Maxime, MOUHOUB Noureddine, RIOU Maxence

This project has been realised as part of our course in first year of Master in computer science, at the University of Bordeaux.

Our project goal is to achieve a 2D ball flow simulator. It must be able to simulate a reclining plate, on which it is possible to add lines obstacles and balls. Its graphic interface must allow the user to create, configure, export, import and start the simulation of a circuit (ensemble plateau-billes-obstacles). The program must be fitted with its own physics engine, handling the whole collisions in the circuit.
